# Quicksort

Implement an iterative (no recursive calls) version of quicksort. Use the
template I've provided in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some
basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

Hint: To make qicksort iterative, think about the part of the array each
recursive call considers.

## Runtime Analysis

Analyse the time complexity of your implementation and give a $\Theta$ bound for
its worst-case runtime. Add your answer, including your reasoning, to this
markdown file.

## Answer
The worst-case would be if each partition of the array are of length 1. This means that we have to partition the array $n$ times, and the chosen pivot would then be either the first or last element, meaning that number of times we compare each partition with this pivot for sorting would be at least $n-1$ times, making the worst-case runtime be $\Theta (n^2)$
